* Make tables, query data

## Instructions

* If you execute the **make_tables.sql** queries it should create all the necessary tables to store the data

* You will then need to import the data from the various *.csv* files found in [data](data)

* Template COPY commands do exist in the **make_tables.sql** file, but will need to expand the relative path to the csv files to a full path to be executable

* The queries answering the various questions are in order in [queries.sql](queries.sql)  
  * Reminder: Executing the entire set of queries will only display the output from the last query executed
